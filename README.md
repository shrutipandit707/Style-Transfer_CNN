# Style Transfer and Object Detection using CNN

> In this notebook will be going through two interesting applications of CNNs - Style Transfer and Object Detection.

 Style transfer is a fun 'artistic' application of CNNs using which various 'styles' can be applied to images. The main learning objective of studying style transfer is to understand how the basic ideas of CNNs can be used to write entirely new applications. 
 Object detection, as you already know, is the problem of detecting objects in images. It is very commonly used in computer vision applications, such as driverless cars, extracting specific text from documents (such as Aadhar cards, passports etc.). .

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

In this notebook will be implementing Style Transfer and Object Detection using CNN .


- What is the background of your project?

In this notebook will be implementing Style Transfer and Object Detection using CNN .

- Business Problem Statement:

In this notebook will be implementing Style Transfer and Object Detection using CNN .We will generating an image using 2 separate images using CNN.


- What is the dataset that is being used?

We have got the dataset from Upgrad which consists of two images.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Using image of rabbit as content image and splash of light as style image in this notebook. You can use any other images as these two images. Here,we trained it for 10 iterations. Remember that we are not training any weights, but generating the candidate image using training. Therefore, not many iterations were required. At the end of notebook, we were able to see the results.

In this notebook, 'candidate image' is referred as 'generated image'.
